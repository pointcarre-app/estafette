# Example rclone configuration file for OVH S3 storage
# Copy this file to 'rclone.conf' and fill in your actual credentials
# 
# To get your credentials:
# 1. Log into OVH Control Panel
# 2. Go to Object Storage section
# 3. Create S3 credentials
# 4. Replace the placeholder values below with your actual credentials

# [StorageS3]                                    # Configuration section name - can be customized
# type = s3                                      # Storage type - must be 's3' for S3-compatible storage
# provider = Other                               # S3 provider - use 'Other' for non-AWS S3 services like OVH
# env_auth = true                               # Use environment variables for authentication if available
# access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE       # Your OVH S3 access key (public identifier)
# secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE # Your OVH S3 secret key (private credential - keep secure!)
# acl = public-read                             # Default ACL for uploaded objects - 'public-read' makes files publicly accessible
# bucket_acl = public-read                      # Default ACL for created buckets - 'public-read' allows public access
# region = eu-west-par                          # OVH region code - must match your bucket's region
# location_constraint = eu-west-par             # Regional constraint for bucket creation - must match region
# endpoint = https://s3.eu-west-par.io.cloud.ovh.net # OVH S3 endpoint URL for the specific region
# cors_allowed_origins = ["http://localhost:8000", "http://127.0.0.1:8000", "https://forge.pointcarre.app"] # CORS: Origins allowed to access your bucket from browsers
# cors_allowed_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"]        # CORS: HTTP methods allowed for cross-origin requests
# cors_allowed_headers = ["*"]                  # CORS: Headers allowed in cross-origin requests (* = all headers)
# cors_expose_headers = ["ETag", "Content-Length", "Content-Type"] # CORS: Headers exposed to browser scripts
# cors_max_age = 3600                          # CORS: Cache duration for preflight requests (seconds)

# Available OVH regions and their endpoints:
# - eu-west-par (Europe - France - Paris)      # Default region, good for European users
#   endpoint = https://s3.eu-west-par.io.cloud.ovh.net
# - gra (Europe - France - Gravelines)         # Alternative French region
#   endpoint = https://s3.gra.io.cloud.ovh.net
# - rbx (Europe - France - Roubaix)           # Alternative French region
#   endpoint = https://s3.rbx.io.cloud.ovh.net
# - sbg (Europe - France - Strasbourg)        # Alternative French region
#   endpoint = https://s3.sbg.io.cloud.ovh.net

# Security Notes:
# - Keep your secret_access_key private and never commit it to version control
# - Use environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) for production
# - Consider using bucket-specific ACLs instead of public-read for sensitive data
# - CORS settings are important for web applications accessing your bucket from browsers

# ACL Options:
# - private: Only bucket owner has access
# - public-read: Anyone can read, only owner can write
# - public-read-write: Anyone can read and write (not recommended)
# - authenticated-read: Only authenticated users can read

# Common Use Cases:
# - Static website hosting: Use public-read ACL
# - API file storage: Use private ACL with signed URLs
# - Public asset hosting: Use public-read ACL
# - Backup storage: Use private ACL
